When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is helpful if you are working from different computers. Or if your computer completely blows up and you cant use it anymore so you need to get a new computer, you can recover all your data from GitHub
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If it did it automatically, git might pull your code while your in the middle of typing it, and it can get confusing and disorganized.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks copies someones repository on github to your repository on github. clone clones a repository from your directory or from someones github repository to your directory. branches help you stay organized when writing code
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
you can do work without internet and it lessens the amount of data that is sent to github when pushing
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would send files by email or airdrop them. this would be more tedious and annoying, but also less complicated cause i wouldnt have to know github or gitbash.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
changes in a separate branch allows for more communication of who is doing what when in a group. it also allows for more files you can revert to if your code goes wrong. however, it does take a little more time to create branches and to merge branges into the master when done.
