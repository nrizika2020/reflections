When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is helpful if you are working from different computers. Or if your computer completely blows up and you cant use it anymore so you need to get a new computer, you can recover all your data from GitHub
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If it did it automatically, git might pull your code while your in the middle of typing it, and it can get confusing and disorganized.
